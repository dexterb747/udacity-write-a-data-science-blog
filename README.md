#Libraries

The libraries used for this project are pandas and matplotlib.

#Motivation

The motivation for this project is that I am curious on how Airbnb became so popular. The scope for this project is to help persons determine what property to purchase so they can rent it on Airbnb.

#Files in this project

The data consists of 5 files which are described below.
data.zip/listings.csv — This provides a list of all the properties with all the relevant attributes to help a person (customer) determine if they want to stay there.
data.zip/calendar.csv — This provides the availability of the properties so that a person (customer) can make a booking on it to stay.
data.zip/reviews.csv — This provides the feedback from persons (customers) who would have rented the property.
writingadatascienceblogpost.ipynb - This is the notebook used for the analysis.
writingadatascienceblogpost.html - This is the html output of the notebook used for the analysis.

Conclusion:
Starting a new side hustle is tough but proper research and analysis is important before you purchase your property and list it as an Airbnb rental. From the above analysis, it can be seen that houses are in demand and given that the price to rent is good compared to a hotel, it seems to be a good investment. However, this analysis has limited attributes reviewed but there are a number of other items that need to be considered before purchase so feel free to reach out to a Data Scientist to help you make the right decision with the right data and right insights.
